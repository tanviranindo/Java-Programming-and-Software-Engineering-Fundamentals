In this assignment, you will put together the CaesarCipher class from the lesson and add a decrypt method to decrypt with the same key. In addition you will create a second class, TestCaesarCipher to test examples that use the CaesarCipher class, including writing a method that will automatically decrypt an encrypted file by determining the key and then decrypting with that key.
